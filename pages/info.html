			<h1>Lingayen, Pangasinan</h1>
			"The heart, the soul, and the face" of the Province of Pangasinan"<br/>
			<p>The municipality got its name from a certain corpulent tamarind tree that grew at the present town plaza.  The tree was exceptionally big, tall and spreading that the surrounding trees were just dwarfs in comparison.  Passersby developed the habit of  looking back and back again at this corpulent tree until it would vanish from their view.  When they arrived home and were asked what way they took in return, they would simply say through Lingayen meaning "looking back".  Since then up to the present time, the town bears its name as "LINGAYEN."</p>
			<p>Lingayen is the home of the most delectable bagoong.  The theory of some makers is that the salinity of the air is a factor why fish fermenting is very ideal in Lingayen.</p>
			<p>Today, Lingayen is considered one of the most beautiful place and most peaceful municipality of Pangasinan that made it worthy to be loved, looked back, patronized,  visited and revisited.</p>

			<p>The Augustinian missionaries and the Spanish conquistadores drew a plan of Lingayen in 1614 and Lingayen was founded. The founders named the town Lingayen at the suggestion of natives themselves, due to a certain corpulent tamarind tree growing on the present town plaza at that time. The tree was exceptionally big, tall, and spreading; that the surrounding trees were just drafts in comparison. Passers-by developed the habit of looking back and back again at this corpulent tree until it would vanish from their rear view. When they arrived home and were asked what way they took in returning they would simply say "through Li&ntilde;gayen". The word "Li&ntilde;gayen" was from the Pangasinan language word "lingawen" meaning " to look back". Since then up to the present time the town bears its name as Lingayen.</p>
			<p>Lingayen became the capital of Pangasinan when the province became an encomienda.</p>
			<p>During World War II, Lingayen was where the Allied armies landed during the Invasion of Lingayen Gulf. Its long beach served as runway for several attack planes.</p>
